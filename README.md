## What is a DAO?
DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. You can think of DAOs as analogous to companies in the real world. Essentially, DAOs allow for members to create and vote on governance decisions.

In traditional companies, when a decision needs to be made, the board of directors or executives of the company are in charge of making that decision. In a DAO, however, this process is democratized, and any member can create a proposal, and all other members can vote on it. Each proposal created has a deadline for voting, and after the deadline the decision is made in favour of the voting outcome (YES or NO).

Membership in DAOs is typically restricted either by ownership of ERC20 tokens, or by ownership of NFTs. Examples of DAOs where membership and voting power is proportional to how many tokens you own include Uniswap and ENS. Examples of DAOs where they are based on NFTs include Meebits DAO.
